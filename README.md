## Notes
- This software is expected to run continuously to get valid data. we do however support resuming if the downtime is less than the configured CandleSize.
- All testing is done on current Python3.5.

- Check [docs/Contributing.md](https://github.com/Galts-Gulch/avarice/blob/master/docs/Contributing.md) for details.

## A few features
- Can utilize a list of multiple indicators to trade off for more secure trade decisions.
- Can easily customize the indicators used.
- Many indicators support multiple trade strategies.
- Simulation mode allows simulating trades without live trading, or requiring an exchange account.
- Live trading mode at market prices.
- Interactive graphs may be created in real time for selected trade indicators and price. *Mouseover Examples: [price](http://imgh.us/price_chart.svg), [KDJ](http://imgh.us/KDJ_chart.svg), [MACD](http://imgh.us/MACD_chart.svg)*
- Consistently pursuing a cleaner base to allow easier community involvement.

## Indicators
**SMA (Simple Movement Average)**
- NOTE: We support two SMA trade strategies specified in genconfig.SMA.IndicatorStrategy; "CD" (convergence/divergence), and "Diff" (waits to pass up or down diff threshold before trend is determined)
- Does two calculations off SMAShortPeriod and SMALongPeriod
- SMA = (Sum of last SMAPeriod candles) / SMAPeriod
- SMADiff = 100 * (shortSMA - longSMA) / ((shortSMA + longSMA) / 2)

**EMA (Exponential Movement Average)**
- NOTE: We support two EMA trade strategies specified in genconfig.EMA.IndicatorStrategy; "CD" (convergence/divergence), and "Diff" (waits to pass up or down diff threshold before trend is determined
- We trade this as a crossover (convergence/divergence) indicator. This is one of our supported EMA trade strategies. On 10/21, when EMA10 < EMA21, we sell (and visa versa). Differs from MACD due to lack of third signal line.
- NOTE: does two calculations using EMAShort and EMALong.
- The first iteration uses SMA to generate the first EMA.
- Multiplier = (2 / EMAPeriod) + 1
- EMA = ((Current Close - Previous EMA) * Multiplier) + Previous EMA
- EMADiff = 100 * (shortEMA - longEMA) / ((shortEMA + longEMA) / 2)

**DEMA (Double Exponential Movement Average)**
- NOTE: We support two DEMA trade strategies specified in genconfig.DEMA.IndicatorStrategy; "CD" (convergence/divergence), and "Diff" (waits to pass up or down diff threshold before trend is determined
- Similar points as the "EMA" section above, however with more of a weight on the last EMA (LOWER LATENCY THAN EMA).
- DEMA = 2 * EMA â€“ EMA(EMA)
- DEMADiff = 100 * (shortDEMA - longDEMA) / ((shortDEMA + longDEMA) / 2)

**MACD (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence)**
- NOTE: We support two MACD trade strategies specified in genconfig.MACD.IndicatorStrategy; "CD" (convergence/divergence), and "Diff".
- CD: When MACD < signal, we sell (and visa versa).
- Diff: Traditionally, this MACD strategy would sell if MACD goes below zero line (and visa versa). We do the same, but for MACDDiffUp and MACDDiffDown for fewer false positives (recommend configuring as you see fit).
- MACD = MACDShortEMA - MACDLongEMA
- MACDSignal = MACDSignal period EMA of MACD

**DMACD (Double Moving Average Convergence-Divergence)**
- W use MACDLong, MACDShort, and MACDPeriod settings for DMACD
- NOTE: We support two DMACD trade strategies specified in genconfig.DMACD.IndicatorStrategy; "CD" (convergence/divergence), and "Diff".
- Similar to the MACD section above, except we use DEMAs instead of EMAs (yes, even on signal). See DEMA above if unsure what this means.

**RSI (Relative Strength Index Oscillator)**
- NOTE: avg gains andlosses are smoothed after first iteration
- NOTE: Want to try out RSI(2) or RSI(3)? Set those periods (2 or 3), and run 90/10 or 95/5 as ask/bid thresholds.
- RS = avg_gain / avg_loss
- RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RSI))

**FastStochRSI (Stochastic RSI Oscillator)**
- NOTE: lowest/highest are from RSIPeriod
- FastStochRSIK = ((RSI - Lowest RSI) / (Highest RSI - Lowest RSI)) * 100
- FastStochRSID = FastStochRSIDPeriod SMA of FastStochRSIK

**FullStochRSID**
- FullStochasticRSID = FullStochRSIDPeriod SMA of FastStochRSID

**FastStochK (Fast Stochastic Oscillator %K)**
- FastStochasticK = ((Current Close - Low) / (High - Low)) * 100

**FastStochD**
- FastStochasticD = FastStochDPeriod SMA of %K

**FullStochD**
- NOTE: FullStochK is not includes since it's equivalent to FastStochD
- FullStochasticD = FullStochDPeriod SMA of Fast %D

**KDJ**
- NOTE: Uses *new* FullStoch %K and FullStoch %D calculations.
- NOTE: Supports both CD and Diff in genconfig.KDJ.IndicatorStrategy.
- CD: When K < D, we sell (and visa versa)
- Diff: When J is above KDJJAsk, we sell. When J is below KDJJBid, we buy. J may go above and below 100 and 0.
- J = (3 * D) - (2 * K)

**Aroon (Aroon Oscillator)**
- NOTE: Supports both CD and Diff in genconfig.Aroon.IndicatorStrategy.
- CD: When AroonOscillator < 0, we sell (and visa versa). This is because when AroonOscillator is 0, AroonUp and AroonDown converge/diverge.
- Diff: When Aroon is below AroonBid, we buy. When Aroon is above AroonAsk, we sell.
- AroonUp = 100 * ((AroonPeriod - Candles since last AroonPeriod high) / AroonPeriod)
- AroonDown = 100 * ((AroonPeriod - Candles since last AroonPeriod low) / AroonPeriod)
- Aroon = AroonUp - AroonDown

**Ichimoku (Ichimoku Cloud)**
- NOTE: Utilizes Ichimoku.IndicatorStrategy for "Strong" or "Weak" strategies.
- NOTE: Chikou Span's cool and all, but we don't care. We want to trade in real time, and a price list 26 periods behind only confirms if we *were* right or wrong. Because proper Ichimoku cloud relies on Senkou Span A being plotted ChikouSpan periods in the future, we still set this integer.
- Strong: if (price > Ichimoku cloud min) and (price < Kijun-Sen) and (price > Tenkan-Sen), sell. Buy on the inverse.
- Weak: if (Tenkan-Sen > Kijun-Sen), sell. Buy on the inverse. Weak is more of a standard C-D strategy.
- Tenkan-sen = (TenkanSenPeriod high + TenkanSenPeriod low)/2))
- Kijun-sen = (KijunSenPeriod high + KijunSenPeriod low)/2))
- Senkou Span A = (Tenkan-sen + Kijun-sen)/2)) ; Plotted ChikouSpanPeriods in the future.
- Senkou Span B = (SenkouSpanPeriod high + SenkouSpanPeriod low)/2))

**StdDev (Sampled Standard Deviation)**
- NOTE: Only here to be used by other volatility indexes
- The following is ripped/edited from stockcharts.com since it summarizes the Std Dev calculations quite well:
1. Calculate the average (mean) price for the number of periods or observations.
2. Determine each period's deviation (close less average price).
3. Square each period's deviation.
4. Sum the squared deviations.
5. Divide this sum by the number of samples.
6. The standard deviation is then equal to the square root of that number.

**BollBands (Bollinger Bands)**
- Middle Band = BollBandPeriod SMA
- Upper Band = BollBandPeriod SMA + (BollBandPeriod StdDev * 2)
- Lower Band = BollBandPeriod SMA - (BollBandPeriod StdDev * 2)

**SROC (Simple Rate of Change AKA Movement)**
- SROC = (Close - Close n periods ago)
- if current SROC > 0, and previous SROC <= 0, BUY. Sell during the inverse.

## TODO
- Add PeriodDivisor support, modify indicator periods based on a volatility index (bollinger bandwidth to start). In a lot of research, this gets rid of the need for "stop loss" in most cases for going into "uncharted" territory.
- Support "Max Trade Slippage" using ADX and asset + currency trade volume, and bollinger bands with bollbandwidth = (PeriodBandHigh - PeriodBandLow) / (PeriodBandSum / Period) to verify
- Record at candle market depth in a new sqlite table, break markets into child markets for better economic significance backtesting (cryptotrader "at market" style backtesting is a joke in the economics world).

## Running
- Dependencies
    - simplejson for API dependency
    - pygal for graphing (not required as long as genconfig.Grapher is disabled)
    - lxml for pygal (not required as long as genconfig.Grapher is disabled)
- Clone
- Edit genconfig.py; find your own successful configuration
- Run avarice.py - This software is meant to be run continuously, and will take awhile to generate valid info depending on configuration.
