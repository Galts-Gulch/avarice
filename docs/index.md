Overview
--------

Avarice is a multi-indicator trading infrastructure for OKCoin exchanges
with Python3. The project was created to allow easy creation of custom
strategies that the user maintains control over. We also strive to make
contributing support for a new exchange or indicator simple (see
[Contributing](contributing.md))

This software is expected to run continuously to get valid data.

Please see top of the page for shortcuts on getting started.
